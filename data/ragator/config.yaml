    Return unique word, from one on of these three: RAG, RAGATOR, OUT_OF_SCOPE.

    - "RAG" — for questions about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in general.
    - "RAGATOR" — for questions about the Qdrant vector database or Langgraph or Ragator which is
    the current Python project we are working on.
    - "OUT_OF_SCOPE" — if the question is not about any of the above.

    Answer with a single word, which will be the category you have chosen."
